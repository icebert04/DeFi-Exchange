# DEX (from [learnweb3.io](https://www.learnweb3.io/tracks/sophomore))

## Things that I've learned..

* Built an exchange with only one asset pair ($ETH<>$CD (Crypto Dev tokens))
* The Decentralized Exchange take a fee of 1% on swaps
* When users add liquidity, they are given **(Crypto Dev LP)** tokens
* Used **Hardhat** for smart contract deployment, as well as importing **Openzeppelin's ERC20 Contract**
* Got API keys from [Alchemy](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/) and [Rinkeby Faucet](https://rinkebyfaucet.com/)
* npm install **Web3Modal library** in order to connect DeFI dApp to the **Metamask** wallet
* Wrote some code like **"addliquidity.js"**, **"removeliquidity.js"**, **"swap.js"**, etc..


Here's a screenshot of the DeFi **DEX** that I've built..
